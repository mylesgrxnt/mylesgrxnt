ðŸ‘‹ Hi There! My name is Myles and I'm a Computer Science and Philosophy double major at Boston College. Currently, I am finishing my senior year of college, working at my university's makerspace, and coding as a Student Programmer with Boston College ITS. I am always interested in learning more about Software Engineering!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in rock climbing, video games/board games, and bass guitar!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Docker, Computational Linguistics, and the piano.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: all my profile links are in my portfolio website! (my email is grantmx@bc.edu though)

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

âš¡ Fun fact: I can do a backflip, although it has been a while
